One thing I have come to realize this is far in my internship journey is that there are lots to learn and you do not need to pressure yourself, rather take things one at a time. When confused, ask questions and you will be surprised at the insightful answers you will get. This will save you a whole lot of time tryling to figure out things on your own.

As an outreachy intern working with the ocaml community, it was a whole new experience to me. I have never used ocaml before but I just liked this language after going through it and decided that it is worth my learning time. There were so many things that confused me at first and a whole lot that still confuses me today. But once stuck for few hours, I reach out to my mentors for guidiance and the best part of this is that they get to teach me more things within and outside the scope of the questions that helps me understand it better which is far more insighting than spending long hours on my own figuring out things.

One thing that confused me the mst was understanding the documantation for ocaml tools and libraries. These documentations don't come with examples and it was very difficult for me to understand. At first, I look out for examples to see how the tool or library was used but at some point, I decided to try to understand it on my own. My mentors as usual did justice to this and taught me how the documentation works and what most things meant.

So, no one becomes an expert overnight but through constant learning practices and support we all take one step closer to becoming great at what we do. So don't feel pressured to understand new things and NEVER feel ashamed to ask quetions.
