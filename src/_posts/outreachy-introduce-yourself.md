My name is Odinaka Joy, a web developer from Nigeria. I was just selected as an outreachy intern for OCaml to work on the project "Create opam package search". This has been one of my goals this year, so it is a dream come through. I have always wanted to be part of the open source communities and has taken few steps towards that but participating in outreachy I believe will be a great stepping stone for me in the open source World.

As an outreachy intern, your first step is to tell your core values and going through the list made me realize the three things I value most in life as an individual.

### My Core Values - Self-Respect, Growth and Community

My core values are Self-Respect, Growth and Community. As stated on the "Outreachy Website", core values are important personality traits. They are things that motivate you when you make decisions.

My number one core value is Self-Respect. Though this is more of an inner quality than a core value but it is something I urge every one to try to build. Self-respect is the respect you have for yourself and having it tells people that you know who you are and what you are worth. Fortunately enough, we tend to build this after experiencing much setbacks, failures and rejections in life.

My number two core value is Growth. Growth is generally the process of increasing in size, but size here means knowledge for me. I hate stagnancy. As a web developer, growth is a necessity. I value growth a lot because it will define my future self. Growth is a value I hold as way of life.

My number three core value is Community. This is something I never took serious until lately. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community" target="_BLANK">WIkimedia</a>, a community is a social unit with commonality such as norms, religion, values, customs, or identity. As a tech entusiast, I have come to value community because one of, if not the biggest reason to join a community is the chance to learn from one another. You can not get recognized without people. People need to talk about you, refer you, recommend you, and so on and this is what the community is all about - helping each other reach their goals.

There you have it, my top three core vlues. I would like to hear yours as well. What are your core values? You can dro a mail via dinakajoy@gmail.com.
